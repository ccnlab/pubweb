# OpenSource & Cloud-based Lab Tech

We have now migrated almost everything over to opensource and cloud-based services.  Most of it is centered around github, including this website.  Here are the links:

* CCNLab github: https://github.com/CCNLab -- academic organization can have free private repositories so we have a lot here that you can't see, for work in progress.  The general policy is to have a new repository for each project, that contains the models, papers, expt scripts (but not raw data!) for each such project.  When the project is published, the repository can be made public.  All our older projects are in large topic-level repositories migrated from svn so they aren't public.

* This public website is written in [Hugo](https://gohugo.io) and hosted very easily on [Netlify](https://netlify.com).  We also have an internal website using same tech that is hosted on our own server -- not sure yet if netlify can do private pages..

* Opensource slack alternative that we use for our lab: [Zulip](https://zulipchat.com) -- has full source on github and can be hosted on your own server for free, or you can use their server and pay same pricing as slack.  Has the advantage of supporting full markdown and also has clear topic-level organization within streams for better organization.  Overall we are now finding that zulip supplants most of the prior wiki use-cases and is really an indespensible tool for lab collaboration!  Posting and discussing incremental results etc is very easy.

* Email lists are on [google groups](https://groups.google.com)
