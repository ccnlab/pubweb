The public website for our lab is: https://ccnlab.org

We have just moved from CU Boulder to UC Davis, and are now based at the [Center for Neuroscience](https://neuroscience.sf.ucdavis.edu) at UC Davis.

Our lab develops computational and formal models of the biological bases of cognition (**computational cognitive neuroscience**), focusing on specialization of function in and interactions between hippocampus, prefrontal cortex/basal ganglia, and posterior neocortex in learning, memory, attention, vision, and controlled processing. We test predictions from these models using a range of behavioral and other experimental techniques. Current models are exploring the role of predictive learning based on cortico-thalamic connectivity to bootstrap learning in vision, motor control, and goal-driven cognition.

We release our research projects, papers, etc in public repositories on our lab github page: https://github.com/CCNLab
