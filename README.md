# CCNLab at UC Davis Public Web Pages

This is the source code for our lab's public web page: https://ccnlab.org, which is then rendered into html by Hugo: https://gohugo.io 

You can navigate directly to the [content directory on GitHub](https://github.com/CCNLab/pubweb/tree/master/content) to view the web pages, which will render partially here as regular markdown pages without all the extra formatting and navigation help etc.
